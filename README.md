QuPath Tracking Extension
=======================

The **QuPath Tracking Extension** is designed to help use QuPath 
for the visualisation and analysis of user tracking data in whole 
slide image analysis.

For more information, see the 
[QuPath wiki](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/wiki/).

Caveat: This is produced in my spare time, and Java programming is not my main 
area of expertise, so progress on this may be slow, and it may initially be very 
buggy.
