QuPath Tracking Extension
=======================

The **QuPath Tracking Extension** is designed to help use QuPath for tracking.

For more information, see the [QuPath wiki](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/wiki/).

Note: This extension is unlikely to ever be anything more than experimental. Also,
I am definitely not a Java developer by trade, so bug reports are appreciated.
